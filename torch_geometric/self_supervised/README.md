# Self-Supervised Learning for Graph Neural Networks in PyTorch Geometric

### 1. **Overall Goal**

The goal of the `self_supervised` submodule is to provide a robust, extensible, and easy-to-use set of tools and methods for implementing self-supervised learning strategies specifically tailored to graph data. This module should enable researchers and practitioners to experiment with and develop novel SSL techniques without the overhead of managing complex boilerplate code.

### 2. **Core Features**

- **Pre-built frameworks**: Include a variety of baseline SSL frameworks that are well-regarded in the community, such as GraphSAGE, GraphInfoMax, BGRL, GraphMAE.
- **Flexible Task Framework**: Allow users to easily define and plug in their own self-supervision tasks, such as predicting node properties, graph properties, or using contrastive learning.
- **Integration with Existing APIs**: Ensure that the submodule works seamlessly with existing PyG data structures, loaders, and transformers.
- **Visualization Tools**: Incorporate tools for visualizing the learning process and outcomes, similar to the explainability module.
- **Comprehensive Documentation and Examples**: Provide thorough documentation and practical examples that demonstrate how to use the submodule for various SSL scenarios.

### 3. **Roadmap**

#### Step 1: Requirements Gathering and Design

- **Literature Review**: Conduct a comprehensive review of current SSL methods for GNNs to identify commonly used approaches and pain points.
- **Community Input**: Engage with the PyG community to gather feedback on desired features and interfaces.
- **Design Specification**: Draft detailed design documents outlining the API structure, core functionalities, and integration points with PyG.

#### Step 2: Development Phases

- **Phase 1 - Core API and Basic Models**: Develop the core API framework and implement basic self-supervised models.
- **Phase 2 - Advanced Features and Custom Tasks**: Introduce more complex SSL strategies and support for custom tasks.
- **Phase 3 - Visualization and Tools**: Develop visualization tools for monitoring and explaining model behavior.

#### Step 3: Testing and Documentation

- **Unit Tests**: Write comprehensive unit tests for each component to ensure stability and reliability.
- **Integration Tests**: Conduct integration tests with different PyG components and datasets.
- **Documentation**: Create detailed documentation and tutorials that cover usage scenarios, API details, and best practices.

#### Step 4: Release and Community Engagement

- **Beta Release**: Launch a beta version to collect user feedback and identify any potential issues.
- **Workshops and Tutorials**: Organize workshops or tutorials to demonstrate the capabilities of the submodule and encourage adoption.
- **Iterative Improvement**: Based on user feedback and evolving SSL techniques, iteratively improve the submodule.

### 4. **Sustainability and Maintenance**

- **Regular Updates**: Schedule regular updates to incorporate new research findings, community contributions, and improvements based on user feedback.
